### Installing the Chart

## Release Chart

Accurate Helm Chart will be released independently.
This will prevent the Accurate version from going up just by modifying the Helm Chart.

You must change the version of `Chart.yaml` when making changes to the Helm Chart.
CI fails with lint error when creating a Pull Request without changing the version of `Chart.yaml`.

When you release the Helm Chart, manually run the GitHub Actions workflow for the release.

https://github.com/cybozu-go/accurate/actions/workflows/helm-release.yaml

When you run workflow, [helm/chart-releaser-action](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action) will automatically create a GitHub Release.
